# COMP 271 002 F17 Lab 10 (Week 14/15)

# Team project: Daria & Jamison

Work in teams of two.

# Objectives
Random Walk: starting point doesn't matter, can visit countries more than once. Prints at random
Breadth First: Printed in the given order, alike to first iterator
Depth First: Reversed the breadth first, some countries have similar order
Closest: Random output and closest given

Why a map might need more colors?
In a real map, where more than four countries generally border a country, we would need more than four colors to distinguish those boundaries.
If there are regions of a multiple countries that are disconnected.
Showing geographical regions between countries, such as an ocean, would need a fifth color.
